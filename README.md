# Guessing Game

A guessing game similar to Wheel of Fortune. Players click on the letters to guess a phrase/quite by Bruce Lee.
The player can only afford to have four incorrect guesses. On the fifth guess, the game will end and the screen will display the phrase. If the player
correctly guesses the phrase, the screen will turn green with a congratulations and display the phrase. In both instances the player will be instructed to refresh the browser to play again.
